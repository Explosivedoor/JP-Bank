# Japan Post Bank Account Vizualization
App to visualize JP Bank CSV files. Japan Post Bank (also know as Yuucho) is a legacy bank in Japan. As such, it doesn't have good visualization tools for your account. However, they do allow you to download a CSV contating all of your transactions. Using streamlit as a base I built this "app" to better visualize your account. 
## Today I learned about Shift JIS encoding. 
The CSV files are encoded in Shift JIS which is the second most annoying thing I have had to deal with. The CSV is also formated incorrectly so it is more difficult to get out the data that you need. 
## Project will be updated 
Project was done quickly, in less than a day, and will be updated down the line. Just wanted to get something that worked going.
